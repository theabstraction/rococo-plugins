You need to be licensed to use my software through FAB and you must abide by FAB's licensing agreement.

AI generated content

	- There is a test image RococoGuiUltra.Test\Content\rococo.content\textures\test\AI-castle.jpg. I suggest you replace this with your own jpg or tiff to avoid complaints from the anti-AI crowd in your own projects.

Free third-party materials

	- This software makes use of LibJPG, which has the licensing terms defined in Docs\3rd-party-licenses\JPEG.README.txt
	- A demo audio of Don Quixote chapter 1 which is the public domain, was downloaded from this website: https://archive.org/details/donquixote_2508_librivox/donquixote_003_cervantes_128kb.mp3
	- The background music was something I wrote at the age of 25. Opus 1. It doesn't really fit, but at least the copyright belongs to me, so no issues there with free use as a sample in the demo.
	- The toolbar icons from www.aha-soft.com are free to use. Check their website for more info.
